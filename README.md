========================


Requirement:
========================
require Java>=7

Note:
========================
The download window don't give a very usefull progressbar... I don't know how to do this with the way my program download files.

Would be multi-plateform, but only test on Windows 7 actually.

Could have problem with some special characters into the filename (asian characters, ...).

Except theses little problems, my Justseed.it GUI Downloader would be work greatly.
